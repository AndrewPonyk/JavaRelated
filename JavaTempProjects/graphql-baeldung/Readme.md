What is the difference between a non-null type and a nullable type in GraphQL?

A non-null type cannot be null, while a nullable type can be null.
What is the difference between a field and an argument in GraphQL?

What is a resolver function in GraphQL?

A resolver function is responsible for returning the data for a specific field in a GraphQL query.
What is introspection in GraphQL?

Introspection allows clients to query the schema of a GraphQL API, including the types, fields, and directives.
What is the difference between a named and anonymous query in GraphQL?

A named query has a specific name and can be executed by name, while an anonymous query does not have a name and must be executed by the entire query string.

What is Apollo Server and how does it relate to GraphQL?
Apollo Server is a popular GraphQL server implementation for Node.js that provides features such as caching, error

What is the purpose of a resolver in GraphQL?
Answer: A resolver is a function that determines how to fetch data for a specific field in a GraphQL query.

Can a single GraphQL query retrieve data from multiple sources?
Answer: Yes, a single GraphQL query can retrieve data from multiple sources, such as databases or REST APIs, through the use of resolvers.

How does GraphQL handle versioning?
Answer: GraphQL does not have a built-in versioning system. Instead, it encourages API developers to add new fields and types to an existing schema, which can coexist with previous versions of the schema.

How can you limit the amount of data returned by a GraphQL query?

What is Apollo Server, and how is it used with GraphQL?
Answer: Apollo Server is a popular GraphQL server implementation that is used to build and serve GraphQL APIs. It provides a number of helpful features, such as caching and schema stitching.

How is authentication handled in GraphQL?
Answer: GraphQL does not specify an authentication mechanism, but it can be integrated with various authentication solutions, such as OAuth or JWT.

Can GraphQL be used with a microservices architecture?
Answer: Yes, GraphQL can be used with a microservices architecture by allowing individual microservices to expose their own GraphQL APIs and using schema stitching to combine them into a unified schema.

Answer: A query is used to retrieve data, while a mutation is used to modify data. Mutations typically involve creating, updating, or deleting data.

What are some benefits of using GraphQL over REST?
Answer: Some benefits of using GraphQL over REST include reduced data overfetching, the ability to retrieve multiple resources with a single request, and a strongly typed schema that enables better tooling and documentation.
