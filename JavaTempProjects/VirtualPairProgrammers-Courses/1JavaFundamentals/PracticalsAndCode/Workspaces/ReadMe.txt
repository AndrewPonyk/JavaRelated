In this section we provide the workspaces at the end of each chapter. For the first 6 chapters of the course, our starting point is a blank workspace - because we are learning the basic syntax of Java at this point, we don't store and reuse the code we write. So you don't need to look at these files prior to chapter 7, although I have included the code we write in chapter 2 in case you want to copy and paste it.

We'll start chapter 7 with an empty workspace, but from chapters 8 onwards, we start to build on what we have coded so far. At any point, you can compare your code to mine. If for example, you get stuck during chapter 12, you will want to look at the folder called "Workspace at the end of Chapter 12".

If you are running the chapters out of sequence, then you should use the end of the preceeding chapter's workspace as your starting point. If for example, you are going to watch the Chapter 20 video first, then you'll need the folder "Workspace at the end of Chapter 19" as your starting point.

To use the code in this section, create a new workspace in eclipse and then import the relevant .java files - note that directory structures represent the packages.
