Domain adaptation creates specialized datasets for verticals (legal, medical, finance) from seed examples. Preference data generation for RLHF/DPO training with chosen/rejected response pairs. Multi-turn conversation synthesis for chat model training. Code instruction generation with execution-verified solutions. Quality metrics include diversity (n-gram entropy), difficulty distribution, and instruction-following accuracy. | VS Code | AWS Lambda + SQS + GitHub Actions |
| 125 | Agents | B | Enterprise Customer Support Agent System | Python 3.11, LangGraph, LangChain, LangSmith, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, React, OpenAI/Anthropic APIs, Qdrant, Twilio, SendGrid, Salesforce API, Zendesk API, Retool (admin), Temporal | LangGraph orchestrates complex multi-step support workflows with conditional branching and human-in-the-loop escalation. Stateful conversation management persists context across sessions and channels (chat, email, phone via Twilio). Tool use includes CRM lookups (Salesforce), ticket creation (Zendesk), order status checks, refund processing, and appointment scheduling. Qdrant stores product documentation and FAQ embeddings for RAG-augmented responses. Temporal handles long-running workflows like refund approvals requiring manager authorization. Supervisor agent monitors child agents. | Enterprises deploy AI agents handling 70-80% of tier-1 support inquiries without human intervention. Agent authenticates users, retrieves account information, and performs actions (password resets, order modifications). Intelligent routing escalates complex issues to specialized human agents with full context summary. Sentiment detection triggers proactive escalation for frustrated customers. Multi-language support with automatic detection. SLA monitoring ensures response times meet commitments. Compliance guardrails prevent agents from making unauthorized promises or sharing sensitive data. | PyCharm + VS Code | AWS EKS + Temporal Cloud + GitHub Actions |
| 126 | Agents | B | Autonomous Software Engineering Agent | Python 3.11, LangGraph, OpenAI/Anthropic/Claude APIs, tree-sitter, Docker, Git API, GitHub API, pytest, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, React, Monaco Editor, Kubernetes, SWE-bench, Aider architecture | Agent autonomously completes software engineering tasks from GitHub issues or natural language descriptions. Tree-sitter parses codebases to build semantic understanding of code structure and dependencies. Sandboxed Docker environments execute code and run tests safely with resource limits. Git operations (branch, commit, PR creation) performed automatically with meaningful commit messages. Multi-file editing with dependency-aware change propagation. Self-debugging loop runs tests, analyzes failures, and iterates until passing. Repository mapping creates embeddings of codebase for relevant context retrieval. | Engineering teams assign routine tasks (bug fixes, feature implementations, test writing) to agent, freeing developers for complex work. Code review agent provides detailed feedback on PRs with security and performance suggestions. Documentation agent generates and updates docs from code changes. Migration agent handles framework upgrades and API version migrations. Evaluated on SWE-bench achieving competitive scores on real GitHub issues. Human approval gates for production deployments. Learning from accepted/rejected PRs improves future code quality. | VS Code + Cursor | AWS EKS + GitHub Actions |
| 127 | Agents | M | Research & Analysis Agent | Python 3.11, LangGraph, LangChain, Tavily API, Browserless/Playwright, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, React, Qdrant, OpenAI/Anthropic APIs, newspaper3k, PyMuPDF, Firecrawl | Autonomous research agent performs multi-step web research with planning, searching, reading, and synthesis. Tavily API provides AI-optimized web search with content extraction. Browserless/Playwright enables JavaScript rendering for dynamic content and paywalled sites. Agent creates research plan, executes searches, evaluates source credibility, and cross-references claims. Iterative refinement asks follow-up questions when information is incomplete. Citation tracking maintains source provenance for all claims. Qdrant stores researched content for deduplication. | Analysts delegate preliminary research tasks (market analysis, competitor intelligence, due diligence). Agent produces structured reports with executive summary, detailed findings, and source citations. Investment research covers company financials, news sentiment, and industry trends. Academic literature review synthesizes papers on specified topics. Fact-checking agent verifies claims against authoritative sources with confidence scores. Configurable depth controls research thoroughness vs speed tradeoff. Export to multiple formats (PDF, Markdown, Google Docs) with proper citation formatting. | VS Code | Railway + GitHub Actions |
| 128 | Agents | M | Data Analysis Agent with Code Execution | Python 3.11, LangGraph, LangChain, OpenAI/Anthropic APIs, E2B (sandboxed execution), Jupyter kernel, pandas, plotly, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, React, S3, DuckDB | Natural language to analysis agent generates and executes Python/SQL code in sandboxed E2B environments. DuckDB enables SQL queries directly on uploaded CSV/Parquet files without database setup. Agent iteratively refines analysis based on execution results and error messages. Automatic visualization selection chooses appropriate chart types based on data characteristics. Multi-step analysis plans break complex questions into executable sub-tasks. Code explanation accompanies all generated code for transparency. State persistence allows follow-up questions referencing previous results. | Business analysts query data in plain English without writing code: "Show monthly revenue trends by region with YoY comparison." Automatic data profiling on upload identifies data types, missing values, and statistical summaries. Anomaly detection agent proactively surfaces unusual patterns in datasets. Report generation creates formatted documents with embedded visualizations. Scheduled analysis runs daily/weekly reports and alerts on metric changes. Supports connections to databases (PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Snowflake). Audit trail logs all queries and generated code for compliance. | VS Code | Vercel + E2B + GitHub Actions |
