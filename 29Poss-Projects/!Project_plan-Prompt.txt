You are a highly experienced and pragmatic App Architect. Your task is to design a robust,
scalable, and maintainable software solution given the technical constraints and business requirements below.

## Project Context
**1. Primary Technology Stack (`<tech stack>` placeholder replacement):**
**2. Short Technical Description (`<Short Tech Description>`
**3. Core Business Logic (`<Business Logic>` placeholder replacement):**

## Your Task: Act as a Rock Star App Architect Based on the detailed project context above, provide (into file Project-X-plan-and-todos.md) the following:
### 1. Project File Structure (Code + CI + Tools)
Propose a well-organized and scalable file and directory structure for the entire project, encompassing:
* **Source Code:** Logical separation for frontend, backend, shared modules, database migrations, and configurations.
* **CI/CD:** Structure for pipeline definitions (e.g., for GitHub Actions, jenkins, gitlab ci, aws ci, Azure DevOps Pipelines..).
* **Tools Configuration:** Placeholders for configuration files of key development and deployment tools.

### 2. Extensive Architectural Description
* **Chosen Architectural Pattern:** (e.g., Layered Monolith, Microservices, Serverless, Event-Driven) and a brief justification for why it's suitable for this project's scale and requirements.
* **Key Component Interactions:** How the main parts of the system will communicate (e.g., API calls, message queues, direct database access).
* **Data Flow:** Illustrate the typical path of data from user input through processing to storage and back.
* **Scalability & Performance Strategy:** How the chosen architecture supports future growth and maintains high performance.
* **Security Considerations:** General approach to authentication, authorization, data protection, and API security.
* **Error Handling & Logging Philosophy:** A consistent strategy for capturing and managing errors across the stack.

### 3. Code Stubs
Provide concise and illustrative code stubs for critical functionalities, demonstrating best practices within the specified tech stack. Focus on core entities or processes from the business logic.
* **Frontend Component/Page:** A basic example of data fetching and display.
* **Backend Endpoint:** A simple API route with associated service/controller logic for a CRUD operation.
* **Database Schema/Migration:** A simple example of a table definition or migration.

### 4. Technical Notes & Best Practices
Offer actionable technical advice covering:
* **CI/CD Pipeline Design:** Key stages (linting, testing, building, deploying to dev/staging/prod).
* **Testing Strategy:** Recommendations for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing frameworks and best practices.
* **!!!!!!!!Important!!! Deployment Strategy:** High-level approach for deploying to the specified cloud provider.
* **Environment Management:** How to handle different configurations for development, staging, and production.
* **Version Control (Git) Workflow:** Recommended branching strategies (e.g., Gitflow, GitHub Flow).
* **Common Pitfalls/Considerations:** Specific challenges or complexities that might arise with this tech stack or project type.
