Hibernate handles domain persistence with Flyway migrations, and Testcontainers provide reproducible integration tests. Swagger/OpenAPI codifies the API, Grafana visualizes metrics, and Docker/Terraform standardize delivery. The UI uses Next.js + TypeScript to render catalog, carts, and orders with SSR for SEO. Kafka decouples order, inventory, and notification services while Postgres (primary) and Redis (cache) drive consistency and speed. Gradle and JUnit 5 are included for build and unit coverage. CI/CD uses GitHub Actions with Terraform plans and Docker image promotion, while Grafana dashboards show latency and error budgets. | The platform processes catalog ingestion, pricing by rules, cart orchestration, payment gateway abstraction, and fulfillment workflows with idempotent messaging and transactional outbox to ensure consistency. Inventory decrements are event‑driven via Kafka to avoid oversell and support backpressure for peaks.
