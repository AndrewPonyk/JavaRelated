IMPORTANT!: if you provide project - provide full stack of project (not only related to item), for example if you provide webportal in java topic - provide also front end part
Provide 4 projects (2 big, 2 medium) for each of the 30 items. For each project: Tech Stack(List in one line),Short Tech Description(Min. 2 sentences),Business Logic: (Min. 2 sentences)
Notes: For general topics (AWS, security, medicine, finance), any stack is fine (Java/JS/Python/C# preferred) Brackets in stacks are main points,feel free to add other tools/frameworks.Use simplest formatting
P.S1 Answer in general would be no more than 10-15k tokens, try to provide answer in one shot
P.S2 machine leanring/deep learning should be at least in 2 projects in AWS topic
P.S3 In each topic at least 1 project (max 2) should contains ML/DL

P.S4 for each project notice IDE in which main part (or all can be implemented)
P.S5 USE TABULAR format (tables are clear)
P.S6 Provide also best way to DEPLOY project: platform and ci/cd tools (aws is preferable in at least 30% projects, but need much options and not only big providers)
P.S6 In algorithms topic you can provide not applied apps, but just list of algorithms to implement (group by categories). And only algorithms and languages stack without EE (frameworks), cover ALL-all topics from stack in brackets
P.S7 Rdbms Oracle should be present at least in 5 projects, Sql server at least at 3, Postgres/Mysql at least at 2 each
P.S8 In devops topic provide applied apps (i mean not just tools, but some real java-python-js-c#-php(pick up which you want) apps ci-cd process)
P.S9 Give answer in one table (to decrease token count in answer) with columns: Topic, Size (B or M), Project Name, Tech Stack, Short Tech Description (min 3 sentenses), Business Logic (min 3 sentenses), IDE, (Deployment Platform and CI/CD Tools)
P.S10 Start answer with name of LLM (which are you, introduce yourself)
P.S11 Kafka is super popular in 2025/26, at least 10 projects (from various technologies) should have it in tech stack
