2. Complete this Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
FROM node:16-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
USER _______________
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

Answer: `node` or `1000` - Use non-root user for security. The node image includes a 'node' user, or specify numeric UID like 1000. Running containers as root is a security risk.

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: echo "Deploying to production"
```

Answer: Missing dependency between jobs. Deploy job should only run after test job succeeds and only on main branch. Add `needs: test` and `if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'` to deploy job.

#@@@@@@@@@@

6. How do you manage secrets in Kubernetes?

Answer: Use Kubernetes Secrets to store sensitive data (passwords, tokens, keys). Create with `kubectl create secret`, reference in pods via environment variables or mounted volumes. Use external secret management (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) for production. Enable encryption at rest.

#@@@@@@@@@@

7. Which of the following are Ansible modules? (Multiple correct)

                sh 'kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Answer: Missing approval/gate before production deployment. Add input step: `input message: 'Deploy to production?'`. Also missing error handling, credentials management, environment-specific configuration.

#@@@@@@@@@@

27. What is the difference between Ansible and Terraform?

Answer: Ansible is configuration management, procedural, agentless, push-based, good for application deployment and configuration. Terraform is infrastructure provisioning, declarative, manages state, good for cloud resources. Use Terraform for infrastructure, Ansible for configuration. Can be used together.

  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password123  # Issue: hardcoded password
```

Answer: Two issues: 1) No resource limits (memory, CPU) can cause resource exhaustion. Add: `deploy: resources: limits`. 2) Hardcoded password is security risk. Use environment variables or secrets: `${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}`.

#@@@@@@@@@@

33. What is the difference between horizontal and vertical scaling?

Answer: Horizontal scaling adds more instances (scale out), better availability, load distribution, Kubernetes HPA. Vertical scaling increases resources per instance (scale up), simpler, limited by hardware, Kubernetes VPA. Horizontal preferred for cloud-native apps.

188. Find the issue in this Prometheus alert:
```yaml
groups:
  - name: example
    rules:
      - alert: HighMemoryUsage
        expr: (node_memory_MemTotal_bytes - node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes) / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes > 0.9
        # Issue: no 'for' duration
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "High memory usage on {{ $labels.instance }}"
```

Answer: Missing 'for' duration causes immediate alerting on transient spikes. Add: `for: 5m`. Alert fires only if condition true for duration. Reduces false positives. Balance responsiveness vs noise.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: webapp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app

      limits:
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "2000m"  # Issue: limit much higher than request
```

Answer: CPU limit (2000m = 2 cores) much higher than request (250m). Can cause CPU throttling and noisy neighbor issues. Set limits close to requests for predictable performance. Memory limit OK (2x request). Consider QoS classes: Guaranteed (requests = limits), Burstable, BestEffort.
