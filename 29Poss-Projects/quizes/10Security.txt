def verify_password(stored_password, provided_password):
    # Bug: using MD5 without salt
    hashed = hashlib.md5(provided_password.encode()).hexdigest()
    return hashed == stored_password
```

Answer: MD5 is cryptographically broken and no salt is used. Use bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2 with salt: `bcrypt.checkpw(provided_password.encode(), stored_password)`. MD5 vulnerable to rainbow table attacks.

#@@@@@@@@@@

31. What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?

Answer: Symmetric uses same key for encryption/decryption (AES, DES), faster, key distribution problem. Asymmetric uses public/private key pairs (RSA, ECC), slower, solves key distribution. Hybrid systems use asymmetric for key exchange, symmetric for data encryption.

#@@@@@@@@@@

43. What is the difference between encoding, encryption, and hashing?

Answer: Encoding transforms data for compatibility (Base64), reversible, no key. Encryption protects confidentiality, reversible with key (AES, RSA). Hashing creates fixed-size digest, one-way, for integrity (SHA-256). Different purposes and security properties.
