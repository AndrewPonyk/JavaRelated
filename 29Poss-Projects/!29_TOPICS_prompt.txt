IMPORTANT!: if you provide project - provide full stack of project (not only related to item), for example if you provide webportal in java topic - provide also front end part
Provide 4 projects (2 big, 2 medium) for each of the 29 items. For each project: Tech Stack(List in one line),Short Tech Description(Min. 2 sentences),Business Logic: (Min. 2 sentences)
Notes: For general topics (AWS, security, medicine, finance), any stack is fine (Java/JS/Python preferred) Brackets in stacks are main points; feel free to add other tools/frameworks.Use simplest formatting
P.S1 Answer in general would be no more than 50k tokens, try to provide answer in one shot
P.S2 machineleanring/deep learning should be at least in 2 projects in AWS topic
P.S3 In each topic at least 1 project (max 2) should contains ML/DL
