1) The framework ID

	When you run your application in test mode('play test') you can 
	see these lines in console
		~ play! 1.2.7, http://www.playframework.org
		~ framework ID is test
	
	If we execute 'play test' it is the same as 'play run --%test' 
	('test' will be framework id)

	If we run application in production mode 'play run --%prod'
	('prod' will be framework id )
	
	So we can define which id will application have using command : 'play run --%<some_id>'

	To get id of application you can execute: 'play id'

	You can then prefix your configuration keys with the framework ID for which the configuration option is intended:
		application.name=Cool app
		application.mode=dev
		application.log=INFO
		 
		# Configuration for gbo
		%gbo.application.log=DEBUG
		%gbo.db=mem
		 
		# Configuration for src
		%scr.http.port=9500
		 
		# Production configuration
		%production.http.port=80
		%production.application.log=INFO
		%production.application.mode=prod



	To get something value from conf file we can use
		${play.configuration.get("application.mode")}		(1)
	
	if we will execute : 'play run' , then (1) will return 'dev'
	if we will execute : 'play run --%prod' , then (1) will return 'prod'

2) Setting the framework ID from the command line

	You can specify the framework ID to use for a particular command directly from the command line. For example to run an application in 		production mode you can use:
	play run --%production

	with these lines defined in the application.conf file:
	application.mode=dev
	%production.application.mode=prod
