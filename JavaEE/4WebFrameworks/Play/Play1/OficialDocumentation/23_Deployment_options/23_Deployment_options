1)Standalone Play applications

	The simplest and the most robust way is to simply run your Play application without any container.
	You can use a frontal HTTP server like Lighttpd or Apache if you need more advanced HTTP features like virtual hosting.

	The built-in HTTP server can serve thousands of HTTP requests per second so it will <b>never be the performance bottleneck</b>.
	Moreover it uses a more efficient threading model (where a Servlet container uses 1 thread per request).
	Different modules allow you to use different servers (Grizzly, Netty, etc...) as well.

	Those servers support long polling and allow to manage very long requests (waiting for a long task to complete),
	and direct streaming of File objects (and any InputStream if you specify the Content-Length),
	without blocking the execution thread.

	You will have fewer problems running your application this way, as you will use the same environment
	that you used during the development process. A lot of bugs can be discovered only when you deploy
	to a JEE application server (different home dir, classloader issues, library conflicts, etc...).

	Please refer to the 'Put your application in production' page for more information.

2)	Java EE application servers
	
	Your Play application can also run inside your favorite application server.
	Most application servers are supported out of the box.

	Deploying

	You need to package your application as a WAR file. This is easily done with the following command:
		play war myapp -o myapp.war
	
	!!! Example (Create simple project with one controller and two actions to process form and deploy to TTTTTomcat 7)

		* create simple application (the name of my simple app is 'deployment_options')
		* make a 'war' by executing 
			play war deployment_options -o deploy
		* there will be folder 'deploy' and inside this folder will be 'WEB-INF' folder
		copy this 'WEB-INF' to tomcat 'webapps' folder
		* start tomcat 
		* http://localhost:8080/deploy_options - out simple Play1 app in Tomcat7

3) Cloud-based hosting


      <B>Heroku</B> (first look : 'great' platform)
	The Heroku cloud application platform has Play-specific application hosting support.
	To deploy and run your Play application, use the following steps.
	
	* Create account on Heroku(set email and pass)
	* Install 'Heroku ToolBelt' (in Ubuntu :'wget -qO- https://toolbelt.heroku.com/install-ubuntu.sh | sh')
	* Login in heroku by executing command 'heroku login'     
	* Create and test local app(use play1.2.4 or higher)
	* Create 'Procfile' in root directory
		Use a Procfile, a text file in the root directory of your application,
		to explicitly declare what command should be executed to start a web dyno.
		In this case, you was to execute play run, ensuring it listens on a particular port.	
	* init local git repo in application folder and make commit 
	* Create application in cloud by executing : 'heroku create'
	* Push your code to cloud by executing : 'git push heroku master' (you need to agree to create key to auth)
	* open heroku application in browser by executing : 'heroku open'
	* on the heroku.com you can rename you application (<yourname>.herokuapp.com)
	* =)
