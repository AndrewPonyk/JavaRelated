1)	What is a module?
	A module is <b>just another Play application</b> however some differences 
	exist in the way resources are loaded for an application module:

	* A module does not have a conf/application.conf file.
	* A module can have a conf/routes file, but these routes will not be loaded automatically.
	* All files are first searched for in the main application path, then in all loaded modules.
	* A module can contain plain Java code packaged as a JAR file in the module/lib directory.
	* A module can include a documentation page.
	* Everything in a module is optional.
	* You can create a module with the  <b> play new-module </b> command.

	Modules are automatically loaded <b>from the /modules directory</b> of the application. 
	You can use the dependency management system to automatically manage your application modules.

2)	Load default routes from modules
	
	A module can provide a default routes file. You can load 
	it in the main application routes file, using a special route declaration:

	# Import the default CRUD routes(crud is good modul , need to study it)
	GET     /admin	     module:crud

	You can even load routes from all available modules:

	GET     /	     module:*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3)	Using the module repository
	
	The module repository identifies all modules contributed by the community. 
	A module can have several versions. You have to check the moduleâ€™s documentation
	for which version you need to use for your framework version.

	
	You can also browse the module repository using the <b> play list-modules</b> command.
	
	For example, to install Scala support in the framework, use:

	play install scala-head

	
	Modules installed this way are downloaded to the /modules directory of your framework installation.

	You can change the installation path using the --path option:

	play install gwt --path=my-project
