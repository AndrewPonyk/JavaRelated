#Remember that order matters in the routes file; 
#the first line that matches the incoming HTTP request is used. 
#This means that the entries that map to the Admin controller must 
#come before the second line above, which maps all other /admin requests 
#to CRUD module pages. Otherwise, /admin/ will map to CRUD.index instead 
#of Admin.index.

GET 	/admin/?								Admin.index

*     	/admin  					            module:crud

*		/										module:secure
# Catch all
*       /{controller}/{action}                  {controller}.{action}
