1)	Few words about testing in Play1
	Creating automatic test suites for your application is a good way 
	to make it robust. It allows you to work in a very agile way.

	Play tests are built using JUnit 4 or Selenium depending what you want to test.

	Writing tests
	The tests must be created in the test/ directory.
	This folder will only be added to the sources path when the application is run in test mode. 
	You can write 3 different kinds of tests:
	 * Junit
	 * Functional(which are also Junit)
	 * Selenium
	
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Unit testing
	Unit test
	A unit test is written using JUnit. 
	In this kind of test you can test the model of your application (including some utilities).

	Here is an example of a Unit test:
	
	import play.test.*;
	import org.junit.*;
	 
	public class MyTest extends UnitTest {
	     
	    @Test
	    public void aTest() {
		assertEquals(2, 1 + 1); // A really important thing to test
	    }
	 
	    @Test
	    public void testUsers() {
		assertEquals(3, Users.count()); 
	    }
	}
	
	There are a lot of junit annotations , and methods (need to consider this topic in details)
