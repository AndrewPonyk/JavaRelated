  <p>Two friends are travelling through Bubble galaxy. They say "Hello!" via signals to each other if their distance is smaller or equal than $d_1$ and </p>
  <ul> 
   <li> it's the first time they speak to each other or </li>
   <li> at some point in time after their last talk their distance was greater than $d_2$. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>We need to calculate how many times friends said "Hello!" to each other. For $N$ moments, you'll have an array of points for each friend representing their positions at that moment. A person can stay in the same position between two moments in time, but if a person made a move we assume this movement as movement with constant speed in constant direction.</p>

   Input

  <p>The first line contains one integer number $N$ ($2 \leq N \leq 100\,000$) representing number of moments in which we captured positions for two friends.</p>
  <p>The second line contains two integer numbers $d_1$ and $d_2 \ (0 &lt; d_1 &lt; d_2 &lt; 1000)$. </p>
  <p>The next $N$ lines contains four integer numbers $A_x,A_y,B_x,B_y$ ($0 \leq A_x, A_y, B_x, B_y \leq 1000$) representing coordinates of friends A and B in each captured moment.</p>
